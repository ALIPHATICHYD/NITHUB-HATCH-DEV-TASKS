 * it will not equal undefined if the program knows about the variable 
 * since this is global scope  it does not equal undefined, it equals 10, the programs knows about the variable because this is a global scope 
 * since the function can access my global variable will run within this if statement where wwe will just add

 * the myOutfit function is going to return outerwear which is TShirt
 * If you run the outerWear = sweater, it going to log out sweater in the console
 * This is because the local variable inside the function took president over the global function outside the function
 * If you log out the outerWear outside the function it will give TShirt as output 
 * This is because we console the function first which is sweater, then the global variable which is TShirt

 * So in this case its a variable
 * If the (isItTrue) variable is true it will return "Yes, it is true." 
 * Now if its not true then we will get to the second return statement "No, it is false."
 * So this whole function here takes any variable and check if its true or not

 * The difference is that the Equality operator (==) attempts to converts both values being compared to a common type
 * But the Strict Equality Operator (===) does not do the type conversion
 * 
 * Struct Equality Operator (===) Example
 * 3 === 3;  So this will evaluate to true 
 * 3 === '3'; But this will evaluate to false because of the string wont be converted to a number 
 * 
 * Equality Operator (==) Example
 * 3 == 3;  So this will evaluate to true 
 * 3 == '3'; This also will evaluate to true because the string will be converted to a number
