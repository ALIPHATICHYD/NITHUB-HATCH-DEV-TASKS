/** 
In JavaScript, there are two ways to access object properties: dot notation and bracket notation. 
Both notations allow you to access an object's properties, but they differ in their syntax and functionality.
Dot notation is the most common way to access an object property in JavaScript.
It involves using a dot (.) to separate the object name from the property name.
For example:
**/

const myObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

console.log(myObject.name); // Output: "John"
console.log(myObject.age); // Output: 30
console.log(myObject.city); // Output: "New York"
