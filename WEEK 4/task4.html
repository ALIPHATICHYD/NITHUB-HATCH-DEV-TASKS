            <h2>What is AlgoCoin</h2>
            <p>

                AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary <strong>proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm</strong> that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the metaverse to its next major stage: <em>Web 4.0</em>.
                Using AlgoCoin is simple, instead of hoarding capital in wallets with forgotten passwords earn AlgoCoin at the time of usage through our unique point of sale system. Each inverted Binary Tree equates to one AlgoCoin. 
                This means if your chicken tender costs 420 AlgoCoin all you need to do is to invert 420 Binary trees.
