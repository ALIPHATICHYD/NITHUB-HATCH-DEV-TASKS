/** Record Collection

 * And we are supposed to create this updateRecord function where we can pass in the ID, the property and the value.
 * And its going to update our record collection with the property and the value.
 * So, for instance, if we pass in the ID "2468" and we put the property "artist".
 * And if we set a different value like "Quincy" or something like that, then we should update thisüëáüèΩ whole object.
 * So, now it says "Quincy" instead of "Prince".
 * And we should return the full collection.
 * So, its gonna update the collection then return the collection.
 * If we have an empty string for the value, it should just completely delete that property.
 * Also if we have the property of tracks and then we have a value, instead of updating the whole tracks hereüëáüèΩ with what we put in.
 * Its just going to add the track to the end of this array.
 * So if you really look down there, the comment says "Keep a copy of the collection for test".
 * The (JSON.parse) and (JSON.stringify) and then 'collection', this is just a fancy way in javascript to make a copy of the object.
