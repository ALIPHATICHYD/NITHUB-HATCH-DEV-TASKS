/* Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object
The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of Aflac.

Print both properties of the dog object to your console.

Tests
Your code should use console.log to print the value for the name property of the dog object.
Your code should use console.log to print the value for the numLegs property of the dog object.
