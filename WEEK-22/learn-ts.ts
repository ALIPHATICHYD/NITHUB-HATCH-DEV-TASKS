/** Learning TS for JAvascript Programmers 
 * TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript.
 * TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.
 * For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number.
 * But it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these.
 * TypeScript does.
 * This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code.
 * The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.
 * This documentation provides a brief overview of TypeScript, focusing on its type system.
 */


/** Types by Inference
 * TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases.
 * For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
 */

let helloWorld = "Hello World";
// helloWorld = 10; // Error: Type '10' is not assignable to type 'string'.

/** By understanding how JavaScript works, TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types.
 * This means that you can use TypeScript to write JavaScript code that is type-safe.
 * This offers a type-system without needing to add extra characters to make types explicit in your code. 
 * That’s how TypeScript knows that helloWorld is a string in the above example.
 * You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion
 * Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.
 * TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that all valid JavaScript is also valid TypeScript.
 * TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*/



/** Defining Types
 * You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript.
 * However, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically.
 * For example, patterns that use dynamic programming or mixins.
 * To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language.
 * Which offers places for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.
 * For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes name: string and id: number, you can write:
 */

const user = {
    name: "Hayes",
    id: 0,
  };



// You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an interface declaration:
interface User {
    name: string;
    id: number;
  }


// You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new interface by using syntax like : TypeName after a variable declaration:

const avg: User = {
    name: "Hayes",
    id: 0,
  };


// TypeScript will now warn you if you try to assign an object that doesn’t match the interface you have provided:
// If you provide an object that doesn’t match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:
// This is an example 👇🏾 of a type error:

// interface User {
//   name: string;
//   id: number;
// }
 
// const user: User = {
//   username: "Hayes",
  
//   Type '{ username: string; id: number; }' is not assignable to type 'User'.
//   Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'username' does not exist in type 'User'.
//   id: 0,
// };


// Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an interface declaration with classes:

interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}
 
class UserAccount {
  name: string;
  id: number;
 
  constructor(name: string, id: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  }
}
 
const person: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);


// You can also use an interface declaration with a function, or use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:

interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}

function getUser(user: User) {
  return user;
}

/** There is already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript:
 * boolean, bigint, null, number, string, symbol, and undefined, which you can use in an interface. 
 * TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as any (allow anything), unknown  
 * ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), never (it’s not possible that this type could happen),
 * and void (a function which returns undefined or has no return value).
 * You’ll see that there are two syntaxes for building types: Interfaces and Types.
 * You can use either one interchangeably, but there are some subtle differences.
 * You should prefer interface. Use type when you need specific features.
 * For example, type aliases can’t be extended or implemented from (nor can they extend/implement other types).
 * Interfaces can do both.
 * You can also use interfaces to declare a function type.
 * This is a way of describing a function’s type without giving an explicit function implementation.
 * You can use this to describe callbacks, or to describe higher-order functions.
 * For example, the following interface allows you to describe a function that takes two numbers and returns a number:
 */

interface AddFn {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}

let add: AddFn;

add = (n1: number, n2: number) => {
  return n1 + n2;
}

/** You can also use interfaces to describe objects that have functions as properties.
 * For example, the following interface allows you to describe an object that has a greet function:
 * You can use this to describe objects that have functions as properties. 
 */

interface Named {
  readonly name?: string;
  outputName?: string;
}

interface Greetable extends Named {
  greet(phrase: string): void;
}

class Person implements Greetable {

  name?: string;
  age = 30;

  constructor(n?: string) {
    if (n) {
      this.name = n;
    }
  }

  greet(phrase: string) {
    if (this.name) {
      console.log(phrase + ' ' + this.name);
    } else {
      console.log('Hi!');
    }
  }
}

let user1: Greetable;

user1 = new Person('Max');

user1.greet('Hi there - I am');


/** Composing Types
 * With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones.
 * There are two popular ways to do so: with unions, and with generics.
 *
 ** Unions 

 With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types.
  For example, you can describe a boolean type as being either true or false:
*/

  type MyBool = true | false;

  /**
   Note: If you hover over MyBool above, you’ll see that it is classed as boolean. That’s a property of the Structural Type System. More on this below.

  A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of string or number literals that a value is allowed to be:
   */

type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";
type LockStates = "locked" | "unlocked";
type PositiveOddNumbersUnderTen = 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;

// Unions provide a way to handle different types too. For example, you may have a function that takes an array or a string:

function getLength(obj: string | string[]) {
  return obj.length;
}

/**
Type      	Predicate
string	    typeof s === "string"
number    	typeof n === "number"
boolean    	typeof b === "boolean"
undefined 	typeof undefined === "undefined"
function  	typeof f === "function"
array	      Array.isArray(a)
 */


//For example, you can make a function return different values depending on whether it is passed a string or an array:

function wrapInArray(obj: string | string[]) {
  if (typeof obj === "string") {
    return [obj];
  } else {
    return obj;
  }
}

/** Generics
  Generics are a way of creating components that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one.
  Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains
 */

type StringArray = Array<string>;
type NumberArray = Array<number>;
type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>;


// You can declare your own types that use generics:

interface Backpack<Type> {
  add: (obj: Type) => void;
  get: () => Type;
}
 
// This line is a shortcut to tell TypeScript there is a
// constant called `backpack`, and to not worry about where it came from.
declare const backpack: Backpack<string>;
 
// object is a string, because we declared it above as the variable part of Backpack.
const object = backpack.get();
 
// Since the backpack variable is a string, you can't pass a number to the add function.
backpack.add(23);

// Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
